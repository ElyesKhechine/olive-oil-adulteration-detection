### INSAT IIA4

**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, ANN, KNN, LDA, SVM, QDA, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, Gaussian Process

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system for detecting and classifying olive oil adulteration. Leveraging various classifiers and data analysis techniques, the project aims to streamline the detection process in order to significantly reduce costs and time associated with chemical testing.

## Project Scope

Commencing from April 30, 2023, to May 22, 2023, this project was conducted during my 4th Industrial Computing and Automation year at INSAT. It involved research, data analysis, and model training phases.

## Technical Details

- **Classifier Development**: Training of diverse classifiers, including Naive Bayes, KNN, LDA, Decision Tree, ANN, SVM, Gaussian Process, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and QDA, using raw olive oil data containing absorbance measurements from four regions.
- **Evaluation and Precision**: Evaluation of each classifier on test data to predict the region of origin based on absorbance time series, achieving a precision rate of 93.33% using a polynomial SVM.
- **Data Visualization**: Generation of scatter plots to compare predicted labels with actual labels for each class, aiding in the selection of optimal classifiers.
